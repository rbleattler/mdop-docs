# Customizing the Self-Service Portal for your organization

After you configure the Self-Service Portal, you can customize it for your organization by adding custom notice text, your company name, and other company-specific information.

## Customizing the Self-Service Portal information

You can customize the Self-Service Portal in the following ways:

- You can brand the Self-Service Portal with your company name, Help Desk URL, and can change the Session Time-out setting to make the end user's session expire after a specified period of inactivity. For more information, see [How to set the Self-Service Portal branding and session time-out](how-to-set-the-self-service-portal-branding-and-session-time-out.md).
- You can turn the Self-Service Portal notice text on or off. For more information, see [How to turn the Self-Service Portal notice text on or off](how-to-turn-the-self-service-portal-notice-text-on-or-off.md).
- You can configure a localized version of the Self-Service Portal "HelpdeskText" statement, which tells end users how to get more help when they're using the Self-Service Portal. For more information, see [How to localize the "HelpdeskText" statement that points users to more Self-Service Portal information](how-to-localize-the-helpdesktext-statement-that-points-users-to-more-self-service-portal-information.md).
- You can configure a localized version of the Self-Service Portal "HelpdeskURL" to display to end users by default. For more information, see [How to localize the Self-Service Portal "HelpdeskURL"](how-to-localize-the-self-service-portal-helpdeskurl.md).
- You can configure localized notice text to display to end users by default in the Self-Service Portal. For more information, see [How to localize the Self-Service Portal notice text](how-to-localize-the-self-service-portal-notice-text.md).
