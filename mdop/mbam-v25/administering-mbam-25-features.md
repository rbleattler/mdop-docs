# Administering MBAM 2.5 features

After you complete all necessary planning and then deploying Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), you can configure and use it to manage BitLocker encryption across the enterprise. The information in this article describes post-installation day-to-day MBAM feature operations tasks.

## Manage BitLocker encryption exemptions

MBAM lets you grant encryption exemptions to specific users who don't need or want their drives encrypted. Computer exemption is typically used when a company has computers that don't have to be encrypted, such as computers that are used in development or testing, or older computers that don't support BitLocker. In some cases, local law might also require that certain computers aren't encrypted.

## Understand the BitLocker encryption options and BitLocker Drive Encryption items in Control Panel

MBAM provides a custom control panel, called BitLocker Encryption Options, that appears under **System and Security**. The MBAM control panel can be used to unlock encrypted fixed and removable drives, and also manage your PIN or password.

> [!NOTE]
> This customized control panel doesn't replace the default Windows BitLocker control panel.
