# Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring 2.5

[!INCLUDE [mdop-lifecycle-statement](../includes/mdop-lifecycle-statement.md)]

Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 provides a simplified administrative interface that you can use to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption. You configure MBAM group policy templates that enable you to set BitLocker Drive Encryption policy options that are appropriate for your enterprise, and then use them to monitor client compliance with those policies. You can also report on the encryption status of an individual computer and on the enterprise as a whole. In addition, you can access recovery key information when users forget their PIN or password or when their BIOS or boot record changes. For a more detailed description of MBAM, see [About MBAM 2.5 SP1](about-mbam-25-sp1.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enterprises can use Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) to manage client computers with BitLocker that are domain-joined on-premises until mainstream support ends in July 2019 or they can receive extended support until April 2026. Customers who are in extended support can obtain MBAM by seeing [How Do I Get MDOP](/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/index#how-to-get-mdop).
>
> Going forward, the functionality of MBAM has been incorporated into Microsoft Configuration Manager as **Microsoft Configuration Manager BitLocker Management**. For more information, see [Plan for BitLocker management](/mem/configmgr/protect/plan-design/bitlocker-management).
>
> Customers not using Microsoft Configuration Manager can utilize the built-in features of Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Intune for administration and monitoring of BitLocker. For more information, see [Manage BitLocker policy for Windows devices with Intune](/mem/intune/protect/encrypt-devices).
