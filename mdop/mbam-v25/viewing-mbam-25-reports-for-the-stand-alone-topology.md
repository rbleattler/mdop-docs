# Viewing MBAM 2.5 reports for the stand-alone topology

The Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) stand-alone topology provides reports that you use to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance. MBAM reports key recovery activity and the compliance status of the computers and devices that it manages across your enterprise.

For more information about stand-alone reports, see the following articles:

- Report descriptions - MBAM stand-alone topology: [Understanding MBAM 2.5 stand-alone Reports](understanding-mbam-25-stand-alone-reports.md)

- Instructions for generating reports - MBAM stand-alone topology: [Generating MBAM 2.5 stand-alone Reports](generating-mbam-25-stand-alone-reports.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Configuration Manager integration topology, most reports are generated from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM. For more information, see [Viewing MBAM 2.5 reports for the Configuration Manager integration topology](viewing-mbam-25-reports-for-the-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md).
