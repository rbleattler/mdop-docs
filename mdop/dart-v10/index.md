# Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset 10

Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) 10 lets you diagnose and repair a computer that can't be started or that has problems starting as expected. By using DaRT 10, you can recover end-user computers that have become unusable, diagnose probable causes of issues, and quickly repair unbootable or locked-out computers. When it's necessary, you can also quickly restore important lost files and detect and remove malware, even when the computer isn't online.

DaRT 10 lets you create a DaRT recovery image in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Windows Imaging (WIM) file formats and burn the image to a CD, DVD, or USB. You can then use the recovery image files and deploy them locally or to a remote partition or a recovery partition.

DaRT 10 is an important part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), a dynamic solution available to Software Assurance customers that helps reduce software installation costs, enables delivery of applications as services, and helps manage and control enterprise desktop environments.
