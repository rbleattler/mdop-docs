# How to deploy the DaRT recovery image

## Deployment information

- [Planning How to Save and Deploy the DaRT 10 Recovery Image](planning-how-to-save-and-deploy-the-dart-10-recovery-image.md):

    After you have created the ISO image file that contains the Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) 10 recovery image, you can deploy the DaRT 10 recovery image throughout your enterprise so that it is available to end users and help desk workers. There are four supported methods that you can use to deploy the DaRT recovery image:

    - Burn the ISO image file to a CD or DVD by using the DaRT Recovery Image wizard

    - Save the contents of the ISO image file to a USB Flash Drive (UFD) by using the DaRT Recovery Image wizard

    - Extract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy as a remote partition that is available to end-user computers

    - Extract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy in the recovery partition of a new Windows 10 installation

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **DaRT Recovery Image Wizard** provides the option to burn the image to a CD, DVD or UFD, but the other methods of saving and deploying the recovery image require additional steps that involve tools that are not included in DaRT. Some guidance and links for these other methods are provided in this section.

- [Deploy the DaRT recovery image as part of a recovery partition](how-to-deploy-the-dart-recovery-image-as-part-of-a-recovery-partition-dart-10.md):

    After you have finished running the DaRT Recovery Image wizard and created the recovery image, you can extract the boot.wim file from the ISO image file and deploy it as a recovery partition in a Windows 10 image.

- [Deploy the DaRT recovery image as a remote partition](how-to-deploy-the-dart-recovery-image-as-a-remote-partition-dart-10.md):

    You can host the recovery image on a central network boot server, such as Windows Deployment Services, and allow users or support staff to stream the image to computers on demand.
