# Application Virtualization (App-V) for Windows client overview

[!INCLUDE [Applies to Windows client versions](../includes/applies-to-windows-client-versions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [mdop-lifecycle-statement](../includes/mdop-lifecycle-statement.md)]

The articles in this section provide information and instructions to help you administer App-V and its components. This information is for system administrators who manage large installations with many servers and clients, and for support personnel who interact directly with the computers or users.

We recommend looking at Azure Virtual Desktop with MSIX app attach. For more information, see [What is Azure Virtual Desktop?](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview) and [Add and manage app attach and MSIX app attach applications in Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/app-attach-setup).
