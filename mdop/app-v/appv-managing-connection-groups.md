# Managing connection groups

[!INCLUDE [Applies to Windows client versions](../includes/applies-to-windows-client-versions.md)]

Connection groups enable the applications within a package to interact with each other in the virtual environment, while remaining isolated from the rest of the system. By using connection groups, administrators can manage packages independently and can avoid having to add the same application multiple times to a client computer.

> [!NOTE]
> In some previous versions of App-V, connection groups were referred to as Dynamic Suite Composition.
