# Production delegation tab overview

The **Production Delegation** tab on the **Change Control** pane provides a list of users and groups who have domain-level access to controlled group policy objects (GPOs) in the production environment and indicates the allowed permissions of each user or group. This tab allows an Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) administrator (full control) to modify the default delegation of access to GPOs in the production environment of the domain, adding or removing users and groups, and modifying the allowed permissions for each user and group.

| **Add** | Add a new entry to the security descriptor. |
| **Remove** | Remove the selected users or groups from the access control list. |
| **Properties** | Display the properties for the selected user or group. The properties page is the same one displayed for an object in **Active Directory User and Computers**. |
