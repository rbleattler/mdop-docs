# Administering UE-V 2.1 SP1

After you deploy Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) 2.1 SP1, you must be able to perform various ongoing administrative tasks, such as managing the configuration of the UE-V agent and recovering lost settings. These post-installation tasks are described in the following sections.

## Managing UE-V 2.1 SP1 configurations

In the course of the UE-V lifecycle, you have to manage the configuration of the UE-V agent and also manage storage locations for resources such as settings package files.

## Working with custom UE-V templates and the UE-V 2.1 SP1 generator

This article provides instructions for how to use the UE-V generator and manage custom settings location templates.

## Back up and restore application and Windows settings that are synchronized with UE-V 2.1 SP1

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Windows PowerShell features of UE-V can restore settings packages. By using WMI and Windows PowerShell commands, you can restore application and Windows settings to their original state and restore other settings when a user adopts a new device.

## Changing the frequency of UE-V 2.1 SP1 scheduled tasks

You can configure the scheduled tasks that manage when UE-V checks for new or updated settings or for updated custom settings location templates in the settings template catalog.
