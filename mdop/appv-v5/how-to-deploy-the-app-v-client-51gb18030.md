# How to deploy the App-V client

Use the following procedure to install the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1 client and Remote Desktop Services client. You must install the version of the client that matches the operating system of the target computer.

## What to do before you start

### Review and install the software prerequisites

Install the prerequisite software that corresponds to the version of App-V that you're installing:

- [About App-V 5.1](about-app-v-51.md)

- [App-V 5.1 Prerequisites](app-v-51-prerequisites.md)

### Review the client coexistence and unsupported scenarios, as applicable to your installation

For deploying coexisting App-V clients, see [Planning for the App-V 5.1 Sequencer and Client Deployment](planning-for-the-app-v-51-sequencer-and-client-deployment.md).

For unsupported or limited installation scenarios, see the client section in [App-V 5.1 Supported Configurations](app-v-51-supported-configurations.md).

### Review the locations for client registry, log, and troubleshooting information

#### Client registry information

By default, after you install the App-V 5.1 client, the client information is stored in the registry in the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\APPV\CLIENT`

When you deploy a virtualized package to a computer that is running the App-V client, the associated package data is stored in the following location: `C:\ProgramData\App-V`

However, you can reconfigure this location with the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\APPV\CLIENT\STREAMING\PACKAGEINSTALLATIONROOT`

#### Client log files

For log file information that's associated with the App-V 5.1 client, search in the following log: `Event logs / Applications and Services Logs / Microsoft / AppV`

In App-V 5.0 SP3, some logs were consolidated and moved to the following location: `Event logs / Applications and Services Logs / Microsoft / AppV / ServiceLog`

For a list of the moved logs, see [About App-V 5.0 SP3](about-app-v-50-sp3.md#bkmk-event-logs-moved).

Packages that are currently stored on computers that run the App-V 5.1 Client are saved to the following location: `C:\ProgramData\App-V\<package id>\<version id>`

#### Client installation troubleshooting info

See the error log in the `%temp%` folder. To review the log files, select `Start`, type `%temp%`, and then look for the `appv_log`.

## Install the App-V 5.1 client

1. Copy the App-V 5.1 client installation file to the computer on which it will be installed. Choose from the following client types:

    | Client type | File to use |
    |--|--|
    | Standard version of the client | **appv_client_setup.exe** |
    | Remote Desktop Services version of the client | **appv_client_setup_rds.exe** |

2. Open the installation file, and select **Install**. Before the installation begins, the installer checks the computer for any missing [App-V 5.1 Prerequisites](app-v-51-prerequisites.md).

3. Review and accept the Software License Terms, choose whether to use Microsoft Update and whether to participate in the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program, and select **Install**.

4. On the **Setup completed successfully** page, select **Close**.

    The installation creates the following entries for the App-V client in **Programs**:

    - `.exe`

    - `.msi`

    - `language pack`

    > [!NOTE]
    > After the installation, only the .exe file can be uninstalled.

## Install the App-V 5.1 client using a script

1. Install all of the required prerequisite software on the target computers. For more information, see [What to do before you start](#what-to-do-before-you-start). If you install the client by using an .msi file, the installation fails if any prerequisites are missing.

2. To use a script to install the App-V 5.1 client, use the following parameters with `appv_client_setup.exe`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The client Windows Installer (.msi) supports the same set of switches, except for the `/LOG` parameter.

## Install the App-V 5.1 client by using the Windows Installer (.msi) file

1. Install the required prerequisites on the target computers. For more information, see [What to do before you start](#what-to-do-before-you-start). If any prerequisites aren't met, the installation fails.

2. Make sure that the target computers don't have any pending restarts before you install the client using the App-V 5.1 Windows Installer (.msi) files. The Windows Installer files don't flag a pending restart.

3. Deploy one of the following Windows Installer files to the target computer. The file that you specify must match the configuration of the target computer.

    | Type of deployment                                          | Deploy this file          |
    |------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
    | Computer is running a 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating system | `appv_client_MSI_x86.msi` |
    | Computer is running a 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system | `appv_client_MSI_x64.msi` |
    | You're deploying the App-V 5.1 Remote Desktop Services client | `appv_client_rds_MSI_x64.msi` |

4. Using the information in the following table, select the appropriate language pack **.msi** to install, based on the desired language for the target computer. The **xxxx** in the table refers to the target locale of the language pack.

    - The language packs are common to both the standard App-V 5.1 client and the Remote Desktop Services version of the App-V 5.1 client.

    - If you install the App-V 5.1 client using the **.exe**, the installer deploys only the language pack that matches the operating system running on the target computer.

    - To deploy more language packs on a target computer, use the procedure **To install the App-V 5.1 client by using Windows Installer (.msi) file**.

    | Type of deployment                                          | Deploy this file           |
    |------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
    | Computer is running a 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating system | `appv_client_LP_xxxx_ x86.msi` |
    | Computer is running a 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system | `appv_client_LP_xxxx_ x64.msi` |
