### Unable to terminate adding packages when using server PowerShell cmdlets

WORKAROUND: To stop adding packages, press **enter** after you have added the final package.

### App-V 5.0 client rejects packages from servers whose certificate has been revoked

WORKAROUND: Restart the App-V 5.0 service.
