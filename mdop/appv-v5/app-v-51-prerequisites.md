# App-V 5.1 Prerequisites

Before installing Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1, ensure that you have installed all of the following required prerequisite software.

For a list of supported operating systems and hardware requirements for the App-V Server, Sequencer, and Client, see [App-V 5.1 Supported Configurations](app-v-51-supported-configurations.md).

## Summary of software preinstalled on each operating system

The following table indicates the software that is already installed for different operating systems.

| Operating system | Prerequisite description |
|--|--|
| Windows 10 | All of the prerequisite software is already installed. |
| Windows 8.1 | All of the prerequisite software is already installed.<br>**Note**: If you're running Windows 8, upgrade to Windows 8.1 before using App-V 5.1. |
| Windows Server 2012 | The following prerequisite software is already installed:<br>- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5<br>- Windows PowerShell 3.0<br/>**Note**: Installing PowerShell 3.0 requires a restart. |
| Windows 7 | The prerequisite software isn't already installed. You must install it before you can install App-V. |

## App-V Server prerequisite software

Install the required prerequisite software for the App-V 5.1 Server components.

### What to know before you start

#### Account for installing the App-V Server

The account that you use to install the App-V Server components must have:

- Administrative rights on the computer on which you're installing the components.
- The ability to query Active Directory Domain Services.

#### Port and firewall

- Specify a port where each component is hosted.
- Add the associated firewall rules to allow incoming requests to the specified ports.

#### Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)

WebDAV is automatically disabled for the Management Service.

#### Supported deployment scenarios

- A stand-alone deployment, where all components are deployed on the same server.
- A distributed deployment.

#### Unsupported deployment scenarios

- Installing side-by-side instances of multiple App-V Server versions on the same server.
- Installing the App-V server components on a computer that runs server core or domain controller.
