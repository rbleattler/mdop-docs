Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5 lets administrators make applications available to end users without having to install the applications directly on end user computers. App-V transforms applications into centrally managed services that are never installed and don't conflict with other applications.

We recommend looking at Azure Virtual Desktop with MSIX app attach. For more information, see [What is Azure Virtual Desktop?](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview) and [Add and manage app attach and MSIX app attach applications in Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/app-attach-setup).

To get started with App-V 5, see the following articles:
