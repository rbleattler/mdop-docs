# App-V 5.0 Prerequisites

Before you begin the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0 Setup, you should make sure that you have met the prerequisites to install the product. This article contains information to help you successfully plan for preparing your computing environment before you deploy the App-V 5.0 features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The prerequisites in this article apply only to App-V 5.0**. For additional prerequisites that apply to App-V 5.0 Service Packs, see the following web pages:

-   [What's new in App-V 5.0 SP1](whats-new-in-app-v-50-sp1.md)

The account that you use to install the server components must have administrative rights on the computer that you're installing on. This account must also have the ability to query Active Directory (AD) Directory Services (DS). Before you install and configure the App-V 5.0 servers, you must specify a port where each component is hosted. You must also add the associated firewall rules to allow incoming requests to the specified ports.

> [!NOTE]
> Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is automatically disabled for the Management Service.

The App-V 5.0 server is supported for a standalone deployment, where all the components are deployed on the same server, and a distributed deployment. Depending on the topology that you use to deploy the App-V 5.0 server, the data that you'll need for each component will slightly change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installation of the App-V 5.0 server on a computer that runs any previous version or component of App-V isn't supported. Additionally, the installation of the server components on a computer that runs Server Core or a Domain Controller is also not supported.
